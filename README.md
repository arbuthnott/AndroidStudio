# AndroidStudio
Java assignments using the Android Studio IDE.  Completed for APPD 2000 at NSCC, Fall 2015.

Notes:
The Jareds_Machine project is a demo for Conway's Game of Life, created as a group project
at NSCC.  The projects are all simple apps, runnable on emulators or Android devices.  They
make use of multiple Activities, Intents, Fragments, various data-storage techniques and 
(in some cases) a reasonable amount of internal logic with supporting Java Classes.
